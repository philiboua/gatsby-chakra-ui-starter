# Feature

Feature highlights a distinctive attribute or aspect of a product or service. It combines an image and/or an illustration, some text and sometimes a link.

### Feature without a link

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Feature without a link">

We can reverse the item order of the feature component by adding the prop `reverseGridItemsOrder`

  <Story name="Feature with items reversed">
    <Feature reverseGridItemsOrder {...feature.withLink} />

</Canvas>

    </Box>
