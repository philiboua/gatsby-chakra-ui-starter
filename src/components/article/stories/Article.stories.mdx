# Article

The `Article` component specifies independent, self-contained content

We can display an Article content through the `data` prop. In this case we need to provide an array of objects. Each object need to have two keys, `type` and `content` An example below :

```javascript
export const articleContent = [
  {
    type: "headline.medium",
    content: "Get started now",
  },
  {
    type: "body.medium",
    content: "You will build website faster with Chakra UI",
  },
]
```

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Article, content defined by data prop">
    <Article data={articleContent} />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

An alternative is also available to display the content of the Article component. We can utilize the `children` prop to display the content. It gives more flexibility as we can provide more component or content to display.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Article, content defined by children prop">
    <Article>
      <Text type="headline.medium">Get started now</Text>
      <Text type="body.medium">
        You will build website faster with Chakra UI
      </Text>
    </Article>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={Article} />
