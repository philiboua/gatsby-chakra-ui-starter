# Colors

Colors are defined by the Greek alphabet.

#### alpha

Alpha defines the main color on the website. It determines the overall look of a site

#### beta

Beta defines an ascent color on the website. It can be use to define less important actions and/or information for the end user.

#### gamma

Gamma defines neutral color on the website. It determines the color of text, background, panels, form controls

## Color palette

For each color (alpha, beta, gamma), we define a color palette. The color palette includes 10 colors that are determined according to the tone we want to convey.

You can find an example below : the file can be customized at the following location : `src/chakra-ui/theme/foundations/colors.js`

```javascript
export const colors = {
  alpha: {
    alertLight: "#0044FF",
    alertDark: "#4D70D1",
    soothingLight: "#C3CCE3",
    soothingDark: "#C1CFF5",
    activeLight: "#214CC2",
    activeDark: "#27428F",
    passiveLight: "#7E91C4",
    passiveDark: "#36405C",
    neutralLight: "#FAFBFC",
    neutralDark: "#A1A5B2",
  },
  gamma: {
    alertLight: "#474747",
    alertDark: "#0F0F0F",
    soothingLight: "#F2F4F5",
    soothingDark: "#DEE1E3",
    activeLight: "#C0C1C2",
    activeDark: "#8D8E8F",
    passiveLight: "#C0C3C4",
    passiveDark: "#5B5B5C",
    neutralLight: "#F8FAFB",
    neutralDark: "#1E2224",
  },
}
```

As you can see above we have defined 5 categories of colors. Each category has 2 colors, light and dark tone.
The unit use to define the color is HSB. (Hue, Saturation, Brightness). Let's go through each category

#### Alert

The saturation is between `63 - 100` and the brightness is between `82 - 100`

#### Active

The saturation is between `73 - 83` and the brightness is between `56 - 76`

#### Passive

The saturation is between `36 - 41` and the brightness is between `36 - 77`

#### Soothing

The saturation is between `14 - 27` and the brightness is between `89 - 96`

#### Neutral

The saturation is between `1 - 10` and the brightness is between `70 - 99`
